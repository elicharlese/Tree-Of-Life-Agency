## 📝 Notes for AI Development

**IMPORTANT:** This document defines the complete scope and requirements for the Tree of Life Agency platform. Every feature and checkbox must be implemented and verified before the project can be considered complete.

- **AI must NOT modify this document** - it serves as the immutable definition of done
- **Each patch/feature must trace back** to specific requirements in this document
- **Progress tracking** should reference specific checkbox items
- **Quality gates** must verify completion against these criteria
- **No feature creep** - additional requirements need formal approval and documentation updates

**Current Status:** In active development with invite-only authentication system partially implemented. Continue with systematic implementation of remaining requirements following the windsprint workflow process.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Complexity Overload**: Too many features in one batch
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-haves
2. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple polling, upgrade to WebSockets later
3. **File Upload Security**: Potential security vulnerabilities
   - *Mitigation*: Implement strict validation and scanning

### Medium Risk
1. **Database Performance**: Complex queries with relationships
   - *Mitigation*: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Complex layouts on small screens
   - *Mitigation*: Mobile-first design approach
3. **Authentication Complexity**: MFA implementation challenges
   - *Mitigation*: Use proven libraries (speakeasy, qrcode)

### Low Risk
1. **UI Consistency**: Design system maintenance
   - *Mitigation*: Strict component library usage
2. **Testing Coverage**: Maintaining high test coverage
   - *Mitigation*: Test-driven development approach

# Performance Optimization Heuristics

## Database Query Optimization
- **Lead Scoring Algorithm**: O(n) complexity with indexed fields
- **Customer Search**: Full-text search with GIN indexes on name, email, company
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Cached queries with 5-minute TTL
- **Real-time Sync**: Delta updates only, no full table scans

## API Response Optimization
- **GraphQL Query Complexity**: Limited to depth 10, max nodes 1000
- **REST API Pagination**: Default 20 items, max 100 per request  
- **WebSocket Events**: Batched updates every 500ms to prevent spam
- **File Uploads**: Chunked uploads for files > 5MB

## Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading reduces initial bundle by 40%
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with Next.js optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: SWR with 30s fresh, 5min stale
- **Component Memoization**: React.memo for list items and complex forms

## Mobile App Optimization
- **Offline Storage**: SQLite for local data, AsyncStorage for settings
- **Sync Strategy**: Differential sync reduces data transfer by 85%
- **Image Caching**: LRU cache with 50MB limit
- **Battery Optimization**: Background sync only when charging

## Memory Management
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL pool size 10-30 based on load
- **Redis Cache**: 2GB limit with LRU eviction
- **WebSocket Connections**: Auto-cleanup idle connections after 5 minutes
- **Background Jobs**: Memory-efficient iterators for large datasets

## Security vs Performance Trade-offs
- **JWT Verification**: Cached public keys, 1-hour refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based sliding window, 1000 req/hour per user
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for sensitive data, bcrypt cost 12 for passwords
- **MFA Validation**: TOTP with 30-second window, 3 backup codes

## Scaling Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API servers behind load balancer
- **Database Sharding**: Customer data by region, leads by creation date
- **CDN Strategy**: Static assets cached 1 year, API responses 5 minutes
- **Microservices**: Auth, CRM, Communications as separate services
